This is a project for ChibiOS on ST iNemo v1 board

Project setup
==============

The default cross-compiler prefix is arm-none-eabi- which matches the 
Mentor Graphics Sourcery G++ (former CodeSourcery) toolchain. This can 
be changed by adjusting the TRGT variable in the Makefile.

The project expects to find ChibiOS source in the project directory as 
ChibiOS. You can change this expectation in the Makefile by setting the 
actual location to the CHIBIOS variable. Different versions of ChibiOS 
may or may not work.

ChibiOS sources can be downloaded from the ChibiOS site at

 http://www.chibios.org/

Building
